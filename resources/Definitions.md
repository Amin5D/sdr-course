These are terms that relate to GNU Radio and/or to SDRs in general. 

**Sink**: in GNU Radio, a block that has "in" ports (data can flow into it), but no "out" ports.  
Common sinks that we use:

- GUI Sinks (Display data in a Graphical User Interface)
- File Sinks (Write data to a file)
- osmocom Sink (transmits data using an osmocom-compatible device)
