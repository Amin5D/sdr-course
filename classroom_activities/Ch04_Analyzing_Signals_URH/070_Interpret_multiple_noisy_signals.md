# Interpret a signal using URH

- Launch urh and open your project folder.

- Click on the Interpretation tab at the top of the urh window.

- Download the following file (link provided) from github ![unknown_signal_4.complex]().

- Put it in your urh project folder.

- The first thing we need to do is seperate and save each signal.

- The second thing we need to do is clean up each `noisy` signal by adding a filter like in the previous lesson

- The next thing we need to do is set the `Center` like the previous lesson.

- Go back to Signal View `Analog` and determine signals `modulation` type as in previous lesson.

- Determine signals `Samples/Symbol` as in previous lesson.

- Crop your signal to eliminate leading zeros.

- Check all your settings and reveal your message.
