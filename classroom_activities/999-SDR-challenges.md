Difficulties with learning SDR as compared to Python (or most other things):

- Not widely popular (yet), and therefore less community support
  - Tools tend to be more buggy
  - Not a lot of tutorials available
  - Missing examples in docs
- Steep learning curve; non-obvious order of topics
  - Compare to Python: Output (print), Input (input), storage (variables), etc
  - SDRs: Understanding basic tutorials requires understanding of sample rates, etc
- Invisible parts
  - Can't see the radio waves to know if it's working
  - Lots of parts that can go wrong without showing an obvious source of the problem
- Obscure / unclear error messages
