What if, instead of this...


```
    ____    ____    ________    ____        ____
____    ____    ____        ____    ________    ____
0   1   0   1   0   1   1   0   1   0   0   1   0
```

...we did this?...


```
    ____    ____________    ____
____    ____            ____    ____
s   0   s   1           s   0   s
```

_The 's' stands for separator. It's not a standard abbreviation as far as I know._
