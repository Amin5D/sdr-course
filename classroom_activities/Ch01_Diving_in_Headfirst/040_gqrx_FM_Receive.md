# gqrx FM Receive #

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember to respect your fellow classmates (audio level) they may be trying to work as well.**  
## Initial setup ##  
- Open a terminal (CLI) window on you computer.  
- The first time you launch gqrx you may want to reset to its default settings using the terminal command below.  
  
      $ gqrx -r    
- On the Configure I/O devices window select the "device" dropdown menu.
- Choose the first HackRF entry which should look something like this:  
  - HackRF HackRF One **123456f** (the numbers are a partial serial number of the device) 
- Change the input rate to 20 million.
- Maximize your gqrx window. 
- Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play button in the top left under "File".  
- You should see some noise and spikes in the spectrum display.
- If you do not hear any static ensure your üíª computer audio settings are enabled.  
- If you still do not hear any static you may need to adjust your gain slider on the Audio pane (bottom right within gqrx).  

## Settings ##   
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not adjust the RF gain.** ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- **Frequency**  
  - Tune your frequency to 98 Mhz. (This should allow you to see everything from 88 to 108 Mhz "The FM band".) 
- **Squelch**  
  - With your mouse click anywhere on the spectrum where there is no spike present.
  - In the receiver options pane (on the right) click the üÖ∞Ô∏è button next to "Squelch".
  - This will readjust the noise floor dB level and the speakers should go silent.  
- **Mode**
  - Using the dropdown menu next to "Mode" select Wideband Frequency Modulation (WFM) either mono or stereo.  
- **Experiment**
  - Click around on different spikes in the spectrum view (some of them will be radio stations).
  - Again you may have to adjust the üñ•Ô∏è computer audio settings and/or the gain slider in gqrx for optimal sound quality.  
  - Also remember antenna placement is also very important.
  - Other than the RF gain feel free to play around with the settings you can always reset to default configuration with the gqrx -r terminal command.
