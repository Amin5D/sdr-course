Together as a class:

Graph a Square wave from `0 seconds` to `2 seconds` that has these attributes:

- When the wave is high, it is `1`.
- When the wave is low, it is `0`.
- One full cycle (the **period**) is `0.5 seconds`.
- Question: What is the frequency?

Graph a Sin wave with a frequency of `5 Hz` across the same time.
