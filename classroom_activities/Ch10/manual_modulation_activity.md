## Goal

Students discover the foundational concepts of wireless communication through a goal-directed activity that gives much freedom in execution, a sense of accomplishment, and just enough direction and constraint to ensure key concepts are included.

## Overall context

Students will work in groups of 4 to develop a wireless communication scheme.

## Details

### Difficulty Level 1

**Directions**: Describe a communication system that uses humming. The system should be able to communicate any single word that is at most five letters long.

**Constraints**:
- You cannot use any visual cues.
- You cannot use any other sounds (clicking, snapping, clapping, spoken words, etc).
- You will not know the word in advance.
- The word will be written using Latin characters (a-z).

**Execution**: All student groups will submit their directions anonymously. The instructor will... The instructor will...
- Briefly look at each submission; decide the order of presentation (ideally worst-to-best). 
- Show the directions on the board and read them aloud.
- Ask for a pair of students to volunteer to execute the directions. (Ideally, this pair is **not** from the group that submitted the directions. However, maintaining submission anonymity is first priority because the instructor will likely point out faults in the communication scheme for educational purposes.)
- Facilitate a discussion of the pros and cons of the approach.

**Conclusion**: If any of the following concepts did not arise naturally during the student presentations, the instructor will present them:
- OOK
- ASK
- FSK

### Difficulty level 2

**Directions**: Describe a communication system that uses the **EMS (ElectroMagnetic Spectrum)**. The system should be able to communicate any single word that is at most five letters long.

**Constraints**:
- You cannot use Frequency Modulated audio with a microphone (similar to a walkie-talkie).
- You will not know the word in advance.
- The word will be written using Latin characters (a-z).

**Execution**: Same as Level 1.

**Conclusion**: Same as Level 1.

### Difficulty level 3

**Directions**: Same as level 2, but **the transmission must last less than half a second.** Decoding the message must take less than 10 minutes.

**Constraints, Execution, Conclusion**: Same as previous.

### Difficulty level 4

**Directions**: Same as level 3, with the following changes:
- Instead of one word, **you will communicate two sentences**. (max character count will be the same as a single SMS).
- Transmission must last less than **one** second.
- Encoding the message must be reasonably doable in less than 20 minutes.
- Decoding the message must be reasonably doable in less than 20 minutes.

**Constraints, Execution, Conclusion**: Same as previous.

### Difficulty level 5

**Directions**: Same as level 4, with the following changes:
- Must include Forward Error Correction encoding that can survive a single burst of noise. The length of the noise burst will be no more than 5% of the total transmission time. The FEC encoding and decoding must be doable by hand with only a 4-operation calculator.
- Time to encode: less than an hour. Time to decode: less than an hour.

### Difficulty level 6

**Directions**: Same as level 5, with the following changes:
- The communication must be **encrypted**. Encryption must be (a) doable by hand, and (b) must take at least 10 attempts to break using brute force.
- Time to encrypt: less than 30 min. Time to encode: less than 20 min.
- Time to decrypt: less than 30 min. Time to decode: less than 20 min.
