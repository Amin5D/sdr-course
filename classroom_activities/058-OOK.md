# On Off Keying

In 056, we transmitted binary data (0 and 1) using On and Off pulses. This is called On Off Keying. The website _Open Learn_ has a [great figure for visualizing On Off Keying](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/exploring-communications-technology/content-section-1.4).

We can visually decode this on a Time Sink or a Waterfall Sink, but wouldn't it be great to have the computer do the work for us?

## Demodulating OOK

We're going to start by creating a Hier Block. There's a lot inside of this Hier block that we'll talk about later. For now, we're just going to build the block, and experiment to see how it works.

Name this `ook_demod.grc`, and since it's a Hier block, **make sure to save it in ~/.grc_gnuradio**.

Parameters:

- Variable (_already in the flowgraph_) with id `samp_rate`:
  - Delete this block. It is automatically created, but in this case, we do not want it.
- First Parameter:
  - Id: `threshold`
  - Label: `Threshold`
  - Value: `-0.2`
  - Type: `Float`
- Second Parameter:
  - Id: `symbol_length`
  - Label: `Symbol Length`
  - Value: `100`
  - Type: `Int`
- Pad Source:
  - Output type: `Complex`
- Options block (_already in the flowgraph_):
  - Title: `OOK Demod`
  - Generate Options: `Hier Block`
