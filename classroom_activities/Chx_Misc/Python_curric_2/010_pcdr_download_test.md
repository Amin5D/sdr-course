Simply `pip install pcdr`.

<details><summary>Some old notes that hopefully won't be needed:</summary>


```sh
pip install "pcdr @ git+https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/#subdirectory=classroom_activities/Chx_Misc/pcdr_python_module"
```

Note that you may get an error about `bdist_wheel`, despite that installation actually succeeded.
