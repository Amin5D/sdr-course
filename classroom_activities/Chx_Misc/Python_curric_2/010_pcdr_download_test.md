Run this in the terminal:

```sh
pip install "pcdr @ git+https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/#subdirectory=classroom_activities/Chx_Misc/pcdr_python_module"
```

Note that you may get an error about `bdist_wheel`, despite that installation actually succeeded. 

You can test the install by running this in python:

```python3
import pcdr
```
