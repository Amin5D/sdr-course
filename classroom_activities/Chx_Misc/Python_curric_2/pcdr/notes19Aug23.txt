Goal:
- Allow for testing without the Hack RF
--> Set up pcdr functions to connect to waterfall sink in GNU RAdio
	Example:
		from pcdr import stuff
		modulated = ook_modulate([1,0,1,0], bit_length=1000)
		gnuradio_view_waterfall(modulated, samp_rate=2e6)
--> Step 1: create gnuradio_view_waterfall()
     Step 1a: Open GNU Radio, Generate a flowgraph with a waterfall, and figure out the python code
          
--> Set up pcdr functions to write to file (for any that don't already)
