## Introduction to OOK Receving in Python

At this point, we've modulated and transmitted On-Off Keyed binary data using Python. Unfortunately, receiving and demodulating is more challenging.

There are at least three challenges that arise on the receiving end:

- Noise
- Received signal strength varies
- Timing

We'll address each of these in more detail, but first, here's a minimal working receiver.

```python3
TODO: receiver = something
while True:
    TODO: get some data

```
