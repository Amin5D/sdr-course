# Introduction to OOK Receving in Python

ℹ️ This material coincides with material from python slideshows B (slides 1-11, 16, 24, 39, 54-63, 69) C (slides 30-38) and D (slides 4-15, 31-37), and SDR slideshow A (slides 22, 25, 28-32, 40-42).

At this point, we've modulated and transmitted On-Off Keyed binary data using Python. Unfortunately, receiving and demodulating is more challenging.
