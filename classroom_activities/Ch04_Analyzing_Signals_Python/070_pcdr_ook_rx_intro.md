## Introduction to OOK Receving in Python

At this point, we've modulated and transmitted On-Off Keyed binary data using Python. Unfortunately, receiving and demodulating is more challenging.

There are at least three challenges that arise on the receiving end:

- Noise
- Signal strength variation
- Timing

We'll address each of these in more detail, but first, here's a minimal receiver.

```python3
TODO: receiver = something
while True:
    TODO: get some data

```

- TODO: Plot FFT
- TODO: What is maximum frequency in FFT?
- TODO: Which frequencies in FFT surpass some threshold?

-------

TODO: discuss harmonics and reflections (note that the latter is not the proper term. Referring to a signal appearing in multiple locations on an FFT.)
