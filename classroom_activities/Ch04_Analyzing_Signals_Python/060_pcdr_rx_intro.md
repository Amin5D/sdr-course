## Introduction to Receving in Python

There are at least three challenges that arise on the receiving end:

- Noise
- Signal strength variation
- Timing

We'll address each of these in more detail, but first, we'll examine a minimal simulated receiver. Then, for those who have SDR hardware, we'll receive some data from the air.

```python3
receiver = gnuradio_
while True:
    TODO: get some data

```

- TODO: Plot FFT
- TODO: What is maximum frequency in FFT?
- TODO: Which frequencies in FFT surpass some threshold?

-------

TODO: discuss harmonics and reflections (note that the latter is not the proper term. Referring to a signal appearing in multiple locations on an FFT.)
