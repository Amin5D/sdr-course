# Interpolation and Decimation

We've seen that the Repeat block creates extra samples. In this lesson, we examine other ways to change the sample rate.

### Interpolation

The word "Extrapolate" is fairly common in non-technical English. The word "Interpolate" has a related meaning.  
As used in mathematics the definition of `interpolation` is: The insertion of an intermediate value or term into a series by estimating or calculating it from surrounding known values.

### Decimation

`Decimation` is a mathematical operation that reduces the original sample rate of a sequence to a lower rate. It is the opposite of interpolation. In mathematics, decimation refers to the creation of a new sequence comprising only every n-th element of a source sequence.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/decimate.html).
