Welcome to the SDR Course!

A few practical notes:

- When retracting the antennas, please push gently in the center of the antenna. Pushing at the top causes the antenna to bend.
- See also the [python preliminaries](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/python-course/blob/main/classroom_activities/ex_0_preliminaries.md).
- Know that the list of Common GNU Radio Error messages is in the `resources` folder.
- Turn on "Show block Comments".
