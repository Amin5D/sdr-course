Well, it's a Software Defined Radio. But you're probably looking for a more in-depth answer than that.

So, let's look at what a radio is. Even before that, we'll start with what a wave is.

## What is a wave?

### Slinkies and Sound

Here's a [slinky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8GcMn7K0u4?t=11).

What's waving? The metal.

You can also make the metal wave [longitudinally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMJrtheQfZw).

But what if you wanted to convey audio?

Let's talk about the classic [string-between-two-cans](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=string+between+two+cans&t=h_&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images).

```
-------                     -------
  Can  ------- String ------  Can  
-------                     -------
```

1. What's happening?
2. What's waving?
3. Is it a longitudinal wave or a transverse wave?

### Microphones

Let's imagine a new, similar setup:

```
--------------                   ----------
  Microphone -------- Wire ------  Speaker
--------------                   ----------
```

What's the difference between this and the string+cans setup?

What kind of signal is carried on the string? On the wire?
